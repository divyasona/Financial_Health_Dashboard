**Financial Health Dashboard with Predictive Modeling and Comprehensive Testing Suite**
**Project Overview**
The Financial Health Dashboard is a sophisticated data analytics project developed using FastAPI, which is designed to integrate key responsibilities across three major roles: Data Analysis, Financial Analysis, and Manual Testing. This project showcases a comprehensive workflow from backend data management to fraud detection and visualization, highlighting proficiency in financial systems and data analysis to help potential employers understand the candidate’s expertise.

**Key Objectives**
**Financial Data Management**:
The project provides a CRUD interface for managing financial transactions, allowing you to Create, Read, Update, and Delete transaction data seamlessly using a REST API built with FastAPI.
Transaction data is stored and managed using a sample dataset (transactions.csv), simulating a financial database.

**Fraud Detection and Analysis**:
A rule-based fraud detection system is implemented to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.
Simple criteria like transaction thresholds are used, and fraudulent transactions are flagged for further investigation.
Advanced data visualization tools are incorporated to visually differentiate fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

**Data Visualization**:
The project integrates Plotly, a powerful library for creating interactive data visualizations.
Fraud vs. Non-Fraud transactions are displayed using bar charts, allowing users to understand the dataset better.
All visualizations are accessible via a dedicated endpoint and embedded in the API interface.

**API Documentation and Testing**:
Swagger UI is integrated for easy interaction with API endpoints, allowing developers to explore and test functionalities without needing additional tools.
A full suite of unit tests is developed using pytest, showcasing manual testing skills for API endpoints.
The testing suite ensures all CRUD operations, fraud detection, and visualizations are thoroughly validated to prevent errors in deployment.

**Key Features**
**CRUD Operations**:
1. Create new transactions.
2. Read all transactions or individual records.
3. Update existing transactions.
4. Delete records as needed.

**Fraud Detection**:
1. Implemented as a REST API endpoint.
2. Uses basic rules (e.g., transactions over a specified amount) to flag possible fraud.
3. Results are visually represented to identify trends in fraudulent behavior.

**Data Visualization**:
1. Fraud vs. Non-Fraud analysis using Plotly for interactive charts.
2. Visualizations available directly in the API, making data exploration seamless.

**Swagger UI**:
1. All endpoints are documented using Swagger UI, providing a user-friendly way to test and interact with the API.
2. The Swagger UI interface includes visualizations and the ability to upload CSV files directly.

**Automated Testing**:
1. Utilizes pytest to ensure code quality and validate all endpoints.
2. Test cases cover CRUD operations, fraud detection, and visualization functionality.
3. Ensures robustness and reduces errors during the deployment phase.

**Technologies Used**
FastAPI: To build a RESTful API for managing financial transactions.
Uvicorn: A fast ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
Pandas: For data manipulation and CSV handling.
Plotly: To create interactive data visualizations.
Pytest: A framework for automated testing to validate functionalities.
Swagger UI: For API documentation and testing.

**Endpoints Overview**
CRUD Operations
GET /transactions: Retrieve all transactions.
POST /transactions: Create a new transaction.
PUT /transactions/{transaction_id}: Update an existing transaction.
DELETE /transactions/{transaction_id}: Delete a specific transaction.

**Fraud Detection**
GET /transactions/{transaction_id}/fraud-detection: Check if a specific transaction is fraudulent based on pre-defined rules.
**Data Visualization**
GET /visualization: Visualizes fraud vs. non-fraud transactions using Plotly

**Installation and Usage**
1. Clone the repository and set up the environment as described in the README.md file.
2. Run the FastAPI server using Uvicorn.
3. Access API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
4. Test CRUD operations and visualize data directly through Swagger UI.
5. Use pytest to validate the system before deployment.

**Conclusion**
The Financial Health Dashboard is a comprehensive project that integrates financial data management, fraud detection, and data visualization using FastAPI. It effectively simulates real-world financial scenarios, offering a robust system for managing and analyzing transactions while ensuring reliability through automated testing.
